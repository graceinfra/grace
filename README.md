**Grace** is a modern orchestration tool that lets you define and run hybrid
workflows across mainframes and cloud-native systems from a single
declarative spec.

Grace treats the mainframe as just another execution backend - enabling
seamless integration into modern infrastructure without needing to live inside
the mainframe itself.
